    "The Hidden Markov Model is a finite set of states, each of which is associated with a (generally multidimensional) probability distribution. Transitions among the states are governed by a set of probabilities called transition probabilities. A hidden markov model works with probabilities to predict future events or states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**States:** In each markov model we have a finite set of states. These states could be something like \"warm\" and \"cold\" or \"high\" and \"low\" or even \"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\". These states are \"hidden\" within the model, which means we do not direcly observe them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations:** Each state has a particular outcome or observation associated with it based on a probability distribution. An example of this is the following: *On a hot day Tim has a 80% chance of being happy and a 20% chance of being sad.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions:** Each state will have a probability defining the likelyhood of transitioning to a different state. An example is the following: *a cold day has a 30% chance of being followed by a hot day and a 70% chance of being follwed by another cold day.*\n",
